## How to Customize Apple Wallet Cards
1. Connect your iPhone to your Mac via USB cable and ensure it is unlocked and trusted.
2. In AirCard, click **Scan Cards**.
3. On your iPhone:
   - **Double-click the Side (Power) button** to open Apple Pay.
   - Authenticate with **Face ID**.
   - **Tap your card** (or tap it once more) to trigger instant detection!
4. Click on any card mockup or drag & drop an image directly onto the card.
5. Click **Flash Skins**.
6. Force-close the **Wallet** app on your iPhone from the App Switcher (or reboot) to see your new custom card design!

### If scanning finds no cards

The scanner uses the iPhone's unified log service, including Info/Debug events.
On iOS 18.6.2, the legacy log service can show Wallet activity while omitting the
resource lookup messages that contain card identifiers.

Open **Log** and check for `Connected to the unified device log stream`, then
double-click the side button, authenticate, and tap or switch cards. If the log
reader stops, reconnect and unlock the iPhone, then start another scan. Values
that iOS replaces with `<private>` cannot be recovered by the scanner.

If your device previously connected but scanning found zero cards, please try
this build and report whether it helps. Include your iPhone model, iOS version,
macOS version, and the AirCard version or commit tested. Avoid posting full
device logs or card identifiers. See [scanner validation](docs/wallet-card-detection.md)
for the verified environment and remaining coverage.

## Building from Source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Amethystos325/AirCard.git
cd AirCard
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```
This builds universal binaries (`arm64` + `x86_64`), bundles dependencies into `build/AirCard.app`, and outputs `build/AirCard.dmg`.
